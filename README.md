Anyen is a simple to allow you to create wizards to automate operations in your
apps. Anyen is written in PHP and it works with both browser based apps and cli
apps. In fact you can use the same code to render wizards for both cli and 
browser versions of your app.

Wizards are described with yaml scripts and php scripts should be provided in 
places where some extra logic is needed or where operations need to be performed.
