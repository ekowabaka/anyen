anyen
=====
Anyen is a simple tool which allows you to create wizards for automating 
operations in your apps. Anyen is written in PHP and it works with both browser 
based apps and cli apps. You can actually use the same code to render wizards 
for both cli and browser versions of your app.

Wizards are described with yaml scripts and are made smarter using PHP scripts.
